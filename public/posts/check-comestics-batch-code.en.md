## What is a Cosmetic Batch Code?  

A cosmetic batch code is a combination of letters and numbers marked by manufacturers on product packaging to identify the production batch, production date, and production location of the product. Each batch code is unique, like a product's "ID card."

The main functions of batch codes include:
- **Quality traceability**: Help manufacturers track product quality issues
- **Shelf life management**: Determine product freshness and expiration dates
- **Safety assurance**: Enable quick recall of related batches when quality issues arise
- **Authenticity verification**: Assist consumers in determining product authenticity

## How to Find Cosmetic Batch Codes?  

### Common Locations
Batch codes are usually printed in the following locations:

1. **Bottom of product packaging**: Most cosmetics have batch codes printed on the bottom of boxes or bottles
2. **On product labels**: Some products mark them near ingredient labels
3. **Side of bottles**: Especially perfumes and skincare products
4. **End of tube products**: Such as lipsticks, foundation liquids, etc.
5. **Side of outer packaging**: Sometimes near barcodes
